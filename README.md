# Introduction

The Product Catalogue is a sample site for publishing products.

A site user can publish, update, and delete its products. A user can only see other users' products as a visitor.

Each product has a picture, title, description and an affiliated product link.

There is a category. Each product can be placed into only one category.

## Users

There are four categories of users: a visitor, a registered user, an admin and a superuser.

A **visitor** can browse products and view each product's details.

A **registered user** can do everything a visitor can and add, edit, and delete its products. It can change its name, surname and password in the profile section.

An **admin** can add, edit and delete catalogue items.

A **superuser** can appoint a registered user to admin.

# Introduction

The Product Catalogue is a sample site for publishing products.

A site user can publish, update, and delete its products. A user can only see other users' products as a visitor.

Each product has a picture, title, description and an affiliated product link.

There is a category. Each product can be placed into only one category.

## Users

There are four categories of users: a visitor, a registered user, an admin and a superuser.

A **visitor** can browse products and view each product's details.

A **registered user** can do everything a visitor can and add, edit, and delete its products. It can change its name, surname and password in the profile section.

An **admin** can add, edit and delete catalogue items.

A **superuser** can appoint a registered user to admin.

# Development
This part is dedicated to the page's development.
## Development process
The Development of this site includes consequently following the stages described in detail in the next sections:
* Requirements gathering described in Strategy Plane – gathering all requirements to the Site. User Stories belong to this stage. 
* Scope definition described in Scope Plane – defining what will be included in the first release.
* The structure plane is introduced at the start of the design, where wireframes are used to create sketches of the pages, and Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) show the database structure.
* The result of a Skeleton plane is the Site’s navigation and detailed database description.
* The last in Development comes the Surface plane, where all design is completed for various screen sizes and audiences. This plane includes all JavaScript and CRUD functionality.
* Then comes the Site testing, which is performed manually using Jigsaw (CSS) and W3 Validator (HTML). Google’s Lighthouse test is used to test the site’s performance. JavaScript syntax is tested using Beautify Tools. The database is tested by inserting data using UI and validating inserted and updated data using UI or database tools to read data directly in the database.

## Strategy plane
**User stories**
* as a site's visitor
* as a registered user
* as an admin
* as a superuser

Site's development is performed using JetBrain's PyCharm IDE, Python version 3.12 and the latest Flask.
The PostgreSQL v16 is a database for storing data.
Git and GitHub is used for storing code and version control.
